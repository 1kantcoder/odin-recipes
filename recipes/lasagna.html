    <ul>5 ounces spinach - rinsed, stemmed, and dried</ul>
    <ul>5/8 cup semolina flour</ul>
    <ul>2 large eggs</ul>
    <ul>1 teaspoon salt</ul>

    <ul>1 onion, diced</ul>

    <ul>3 1/2 ounces lean ground pork</ul>
    <ul> 3 1/2 ounces lean ground beef</ul>
    <ul> 3 1/2 ounces minced ham</ul>
    <ul> 1 cup beef stock</ul>
    <ul> 2 tablespoon dried oregano</ul>

    <ul> 3 1/2 ounces chicken livers, trimmed and chopped</ul>
    <strong>Bechamel:</strong>
    <ul>2 tablespoons butter</ul>
    <ul>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</ul>
    <ul>2 cups warm milk</ul>
    <ul>1 pinch salt</ul>
    <ul>1 pinch ground nutmeg</ul>
    <strong>Cheese:</strong>
    <ul>1 pint ricotta cheese</ul>
    <ul>1 2/3 cups grated Parmesan cheese</ul>
    <ul>3 tablespoons butter</ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make pasta:</strong> Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water
        to a boil. Add spinach, cover, and steam until bright green, about 2 minutes. Squeeze spinach to remove excess moisture and process in a food processor to make a paste. Add semolina, eggs
        and salt; process until smooth. Transfer mixture to a large bowl and stir in enough flour to make a smooth dough. Knead briefly, then cover with a dish towel and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Make ragu:</strong> While ragu is simmering, make bechamel: Combine butter and flour in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk to make a roux.
        Remove from heat, let rest for 1 minute, then whisk in warm milk. Return to heat and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring constantly, until thickened. Season with salt and nutmeg. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook pasta:</strong>Prepare an ice bath. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. On a floured surface, divide pasta dough
        into 3 portions. Roll each portion out to a thin sheet. Cook each pasta
        sheet in boiling water for 3 minutes; remove and dip in ice water; drain and dry on a clean cloth.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish ragu: </strong>Stir chicken livers into simmering sauce. Cook for 1 minute, remove from heat, and set aside-</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble lasagna:</strong>Place 1 pasta sheet in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Spread 1/3 of the ragu, 1/4 of the bechamel, 1/3 of the ricotta, and 1/4 of the Parmesan over pasta.
        Repeat layers twice. Top with remaining bechamel and Parmesan; dot with butter</li>
        <li> Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
